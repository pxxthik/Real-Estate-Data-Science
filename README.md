# 🏡 Real Estate Data Science Capstone

## Overview
This project applies data science to real estate to help analyze and predict property trends. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and building machine learning models. A recommendation system suggests properties based on user preferences. Visualizations provide insights into market patterns. The final product is a complete pipeline with a simple, user-friendly app.

## Features

- 🏠 **Price Predictor**: Machine learning model to estimate property prices in Gurgaon.
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualizations for market trends, property distributions, and geospatial analysis.
- 💡 **Apartment Recommender**: Content-based system to suggest apartments based on user preferences.
- 🔄 **Data Pipeline**: Fully reproducible DVC pipeline for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Model Comparison
The project evaluates various regression models for predicting property prices, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regressor, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), LASSO Regression, Ridge Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor, and ElasticNet Regression.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main application file to launch the user interface and explore features, predictions, and recommendations.
